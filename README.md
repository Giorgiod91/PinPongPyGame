# Ping Pong Game

A simple yet engaging Ping Pong game built with **Python** and **Pygame**, where players can control their paddle, compete against an AI enemy, and aim to score goals while dodging randomly placed obstacles. The game includes features like speed boosts, shrinking paddles when hit by the ball, and a defense cooldown mechanism.

## Features

- **Player Controls**: Move the player paddle using the arrow keys (`W`, `A`, `S`, `D`).
- **AI Enemy**: The enemy paddle follows the ball using an automated movement system.
- **Ball Mechanics**: The ball bounces off the edges of the screen, as well as paddles and objects.
- **Goal Detection**: Score a goal by getting the ball past the enemy, and watch the game dynamics change (paddles grow bigger, speed boosts become available).
- **Speed Boost**: Triggered after every 3 goals, press `Space` to boost the ball speed temporarily.
- **Defense Cooldown**: Activate a defense cooldown with `R` to change the player's paddle color for 5 seconds.
- **Random Objects**: Obstacles are randomly placed on the screen, making the game more challenging.
